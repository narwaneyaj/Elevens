Out of the 12 games I've played, I won one of the games

1. List all possible plays for the board 5♠ 4♥ 2♦ 6♣ A♠ J♥ K♦ 5♣ 2♠
	5♠: 6 of any suit
	4♥: 7 of any suit
	2♦: 9 of any suit
	6♣: 5 of any suit
	A♠: 10 of any suit
	J♥: A king and a queen of any suit
	K♦: A queen and a jack of any suit
	5♣: 6 of any suit
	2♠: 9 of any suit
	
2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?
	They must be a J, Q, and K because all of the other numbers are replaced in pairs, and if there are three cards left, two of them can be a pair, but nothing would happen to the remaining card. Therefore the last three cards must be J, K, and Q because they are the only ones divisible by 3.
	
3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.
	It may seem like it matters which one you pick, but the next to cards that come in are completely random, so you would never know which ones would replace which cards, so actually, it doesn't really matter which strategy you choose.
